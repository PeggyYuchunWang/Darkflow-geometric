# Darkflow-geometric

Contains dataset generation tools (must get background images and EMNIST
dataset). For training YOLO on your generated dataset, follow the directions
given here: https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow

Loss should go down from 114-ish to 1.4-ish in around 3 epochs for 10 classes or 1-class lump.
